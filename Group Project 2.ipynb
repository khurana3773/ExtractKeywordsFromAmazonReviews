life, excellent screen no lags in interface.', 'I received my Cell a month ago and after use during this time in Venezuela with Telefónica Movilnet I can confidently say that it works perfectly , lift 3G in some areas very easily (when available understanding which mobile networks in Venezuela are quite poor and ineffective ) EDGE rest always remains that is not connected to a WiFi network which works extremely fast and without any kind of hesitation or momentary freeze as it used to happen with my old Sansung Galaxy .Automatically I update a few minutes on the Android KitKat version perfectly and operation in all applications is simply outstanding , so far has not been frozen for the first time and applications ( both own and downloaded and installed play store) is rise and meet their objectives efficiently and very fast way .Google for buying Motorola ( from there the advantage of the automatic update to Android KitKat ) provides 50 GB free for 2 years I could redeem Drive without a glitch and use it instantly and now storing information that can be viewed through any device with an Internet connection anywhere in the world.With respect to what I consider a great design for a mid-range phone and its weight is one of the things that I like in particular and makes you feel more rustic and rugged without taking anything of its elegance, its screen is super crisp touch and feel very, very well having a high sensitivity it deserves little effort and reduces the possibility of repetition to fulfill the commands that the user wants.The battery is one of the more interesting things as it lasts one day and part of another without being attached to a charger or PC and this is giving constant use with social networking , email, calls and messaging.The only observation to take into account would improve or replace 5mp camera for a superior , even if the conditions for taking photographs are the best in lighting and backlighting , these are fantastic.Definitely a good midrange Cell recommend them and my experience has been very successful since its price earnings ratio is simply rewarding._______Recibí mi equipo hace un mes y luego de utilizarlo durante este tiempo en Venezuela con la Telefónica Movilnet puedo decir confiadamente que funciona a la perfección, levanta 3G en algunas zonas con gran facilidad (cuando esta esta disponible entendiendo que las redes móviles en Venezuela son bastantes pobres e ineficaces) de resto se mantiene EDGE siempre que no este conectado a una red WiFi con la cual funciona extremadamente rápido y sin ningun tipo de titubeo o congelamiento momentáneo como solía pasar con mi antiguo Sansung Galaxy.Se actualizo automáticamente a los pocos minutos de encendido a la versión Android KitKat perfectamente y el funcionamiento en todas sus aplicaciones es simplemente excepcional, hasta ahora no se ha congelado por primera vez y las aplicaciones (tanto propias como descargadas e instaladas de play store) se levantan y cumplen con sus objetivos de manera eficiente y muy veloces.Motorola por haber adquirido Google (de alli la ventaja de la actualización automática a Android KitKat) provee 50 GB gratis por 2 años en Drive lo que pude canjear sin ningún inconveniente y de manera instantánea y actualmente lo utilizo almacenando información que puedo visualizar a través de cualquier dispositivo con conexión a Internet en cualquier parte del mundo.Con respecto a su diseño lo considero espectacular para un teléfono de gama media y su peso es una de las cosas que mas me gusta en lo particular ya que lo hace sentir mas rustico y resistente sin restarle nada a su elegancia, su pantalla es super nítida y al tacto se siente muy pero muy bien teniendo una alta sensibilidad que amerita poco esfuerzo y reduce la posibilidad de repetición para cumplir con los comando que el usuario desee.La batería es una de las cosas mas interesantes ya que dura un día y parte del otro sin necesidad de estar pegado a un cargador o PC y esto es dándole un uso constante con redes sociales , correo electrónico, llamadas y mensajería.La única observación para tomar en cuenta seria mejorar o sustituir la cámara de 5mp por una superior, aunque si las condiciones para tomar las fotografías son las idóneas en cuanto a iluminación y retro iluminación, estas son fantásticas.Definitivamente es un buen Equipo de gama media que recomiendo ampliamente y mi experiencia ha sido muy satisfactoria ya que su relación precio beneficio es sencillamente gratificante', \"All these 4,5,6,7 hundred

nice but not as good as the reviews made me expect.-camera is not very good.', 'Good battery life that can easily last a day under normal usage.', 'It is a new phone with a new operating system so best to wait as they work out the bugs.What sold me on the Moto G was the battery life.', 'Maybe the lack of LTE is adding to the battery, but with moderate talking and with most battery saving settings in place, I get 4 days between charges.', 'However, would not repurchase this or any other phone that you can not change battery your self.', \"I'm an average phone user, and I noticed that the battery lasts about a day.\", 'The OS takes a lot of battery to run.', 'No drop calls.Overall, Good phone, but bad battery in my opinion.', \"Super phone...worth more than the price tag.The build quality beats so many high end android phones like galaxy S4.Fast and sleek, you can't go wrong with this beauty.Of all the smartphones I've ever used including iPhone 4S, none can beat the battery life of this phone...\", 'Pro:Great cell phone, considering quality/price.Using the save energy in mode on, the battery life is around 36 hsCons:Using the save battery in mode off, the battery life is around of 18 hs.', 'The battery lasts all day, sometimes more.', 'Could be even better if battery could be designed for longer use.', 'Good Mobile for good price,Very easy to useThis phone got very

well that's not so.\", \"Though, in 4.4.2 Kitkat, the 'battery saver' option won't stay on anymore, nor does it activate automatically when it's supposed to.The bad:* Low capacity built-in storage and no memory card support is a bad combination.\", '* Wakelock bugs (Phone app, Mediaserver) -- they can consume a lot of battery power.', 'good phonejust i have one problem in the second days, the phone restart and then the battery status was 1%(the battery was completely charged, the phone never turn off (in the  next 2 days) until i charge again, and all the time show 1%, i contact Motorola and not

android .after using it for more than 2 months the battery remains the same, about 24 hours, I not spend all day looking at facebook or twitter , notifications were disconnected to also have a good battery performance .I've downloaded some that I use daily as:Any.doAvgCal: Any.doDropboxTouchPal Keyboard XTwiterFacebookUnit ConverterBatteryBot Battery Indicator ( shows you the percentage of

low, if the battery has just been charged, or just because.', 'I had to return the phone due to a faulty battery, and as I had it sent internationally it is going to be weeks before I get the replacement.', 'I love it--except... the battery was dead and the phone would not turn on when plugged in to car or wall charger.', 'When a Moto G battery discharges, it will not turn on.', 'It will not turn on even though it has a few percent of battery life and is plugged into a charger.', 'If the battery of a Moto G does not have a few percent of battery charge, it will not turn on.', '2 months before having WI-Fi connection problems, then 15 days later out of the blue while having the phone in my pocket the phone shut off itself , I tried every method under the earth to tun it on, I even called Motorola customer services like 5 times at not avail , then went to my local carrier maybe to see if there was any battery problem, they told me only Motorola can open up this phone, then called Motorola , they provided all the resources to have the phone ship to them, this is where it get phony , they returned my piece of garbage phone unfixed because they claim I tampered with the phone.While the phone worked it was very good for that price, BE AWARE IF YOU DAMAGED YOUR PHONE OR WHATEVER IT GONNA TAKE 20 DAYS FOR YOU WITHOUT A PHONE BEFORE THEY GOT A ANSWER FOR YOU.I just lost

that this is considered a \"value smartphone\" but I don\\'t think it is worth any amount of money if it is completely useless after letting the battery die.', 'I tried to access it through Instagram
