3G in some areas very easily (when available understanding which mobile networks in Venezuela are quite poor and ineffective ) EDGE rest always remains that is not connected to a WiFi network which works extremely fast and without any kind of hesitation or momentary freeze as it used to happen with my old Sansung Galaxy .Automatically I update a few minutes on the Android KitKat version perfectly and operation in all applications is simply outstanding , so far has not been frozen for the first time and applications ( both own and downloaded and installed play store) is rise and meet their objectives efficiently and very fast way .Google for buying Motorola ( from there the advantage of the automatic update to Android KitKat ) provides 50 GB free for 2 years I could redeem Drive without a glitch and use it instantly and now storing information that can be viewed through any device with an Internet connection anywhere in the world.With respect to what I consider a great design for a mid-range phone and its weight is one of the things that I like in particular and makes you feel more rustic and rugged without taking anything of its elegance, its screen is super crisp touch and feel very, very well having a high sensitivity it deserves little effort and reduces the possibility of repetition to fulfill the commands that the user wants.The battery is one of the more interesting things as it lasts one day and part of another without being attached to a charger or PC and this is giving constant use with social networking , email, calls and messaging.The only observation to take into account would improve or replace 5mp camera for a superior , even if the conditions for taking photographs are the best in lighting and backlighting , these are fantastic.Definitely a good midrange Cell recommend them and my experience has been very successful since its price earnings ratio is simply rewarding._______Recibí mi equipo hace un mes y luego de utilizarlo durante este tiempo en Venezuela con la Telefónica Movilnet puedo decir confiadamente que funciona a la perfección, levanta 3G en algunas zonas con gran facilidad (cuando esta esta disponible entendiendo que las redes móviles en Venezuela son bastantes pobres e ineficaces) de resto se mantiene EDGE siempre que no este conectado a una red WiFi con la cual funciona extremadamente rápido y sin ningun tipo de titubeo o congelamiento momentáneo como solía pasar con mi antiguo Sansung Galaxy.Se actualizo automáticamente a los pocos minutos de encendido a la versión Android KitKat perfectamente y el funcionamiento en todas sus aplicaciones es simplemente excepcional, hasta ahora no se ha congelado por primera vez y las aplicaciones (tanto propias como descargadas e instaladas de play store) se levantan y cumplen con sus objetivos de manera eficiente y muy veloces.Motorola por haber adquirido Google (de alli la ventaja de la actualización automática a Android KitKat) provee 50 GB gratis por 2 años en Drive lo que pude canjear sin ningún inconveniente y de manera instantánea y actualmente lo utilizo almacenando información que puedo visualizar a través de cualquier dispositivo con conexión a Internet en cualquier parte del mundo.Con respecto a su diseño lo considero espectacular para un teléfono de gama media y su peso es una de las cosas que mas me gusta en lo particular ya que lo hace sentir mas rustico y resistente sin restarle nada a su elegancia, su pantalla es super nítida y al tacto se siente muy pero muy bien teniendo una alta sensibilidad que amerita poco esfuerzo y reduce la posibilidad de repetición para cumplir con los comando que el usuario desee.La batería es una de las cosas mas interesantes ya que dura un día y parte del otro sin necesidad de estar pegado a un cargador o PC y esto es dándole un uso constante con redes sociales , correo electrónico, llamadas y mensajería.La única observación para tomar en cuenta seria mejorar o sustituir la cámara de 5mp por una superior, aunque si las condiciones para tomar las fotografías son las idóneas en cuanto a iluminación y retro iluminación, estas son fantásticas.Definitivamente es un buen Equipo de gama media que recomiendo ampliamente y mi experiencia ha sido muy satisfactoria ya que su relación precio beneficio es sencillamente gratificante', \"All these 4,5,6,7 hundred
